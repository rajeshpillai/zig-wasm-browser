# The Goal
The goal of this project is to learn and teach zig wasm + browser + html5 canvas step by step by tiny working examples one function or one micro feature at a time.  Once the basic learing/tutorials are done, we will build a game using zig wasm + browser + html5 canvas, a image processing app etc.


# Action Plan
1.  For each micro concept start with code, test it and then in the tutorials folder create a detailed tutorial for it.
2.  Some tutorials which are conceptual might not have an code this will be at 00 index and as applicable.
3.  Keep JS, HTML, WASM output in the public folder.
